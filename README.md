# OneSound-Android
OneSound is an app that lets everyone at a party or event be the DJ.

How it works:
When you're hosting a party, you create a Party in our app, and you and your friends join that Party. Within that Party, you add the songs you want to hear, you vote up/down on the songs your friends add, and our app creates a live, updated playlist based on what everyone wants to hear. The music plays through the Party host's device, and guests do the voting and song submission through their personal phones.
